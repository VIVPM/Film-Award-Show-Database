# Film Award Show Database

<h4>A group of sponsors sign to conduct an award show in the field of movies every year to appreciate the filmmakers, actors, and musicians who work on the movies. The sponsors sign a contract with the members of the jury panel for a certain period. A number of nominees are selected for each award by the popularity and box office collections of their particular films and songs. The jury carefully examines the nomineesâ€™ performance and selects a winner among them. Awards of various categories are given to winners, but every award can have only one winner. Each award is identified with a unique Id and its nominees for each award are uniquely identified with a nominee Id. The jury panel is decided by all the sponsors together. The show is made entertaining by performances like dancing, singing, funny anecdotes by the anchor. Each sponsor can hire several performers who act in different categories. Each performer has a unique Id. The awards are presented to the winners by award presenters who reveal the winners to the audience and hand the trophy to them. Each award presenter has a unique Id and he/she can give out one award.</h4>
